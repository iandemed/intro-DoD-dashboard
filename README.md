# intro-DoD-shinydashboard

## Overview
A simple Shiny dashboard that implements concepts I learned while working on a larger dashboard project at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. With the help of packrat, the dashboard is ready to run immediately after downloading from the repository. There are various tabs to investigate the age distribution for "Deaths of Despair", download buttons to save the charts locally, and hyperlinks connecting inviduals to suicide prevention resources.

Due to the size of the sql database and the packrat directory, both have been compressed before being uploaded. Each of these files will need to be decompressed to the same directory as the app.R file.
